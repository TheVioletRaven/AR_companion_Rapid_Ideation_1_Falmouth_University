In my rapid ideation, I explored how empathy and ethics can shape an AR companion. I conducted research into how emotional design, transparency, and trust influence human–AI interaction. Based on those insights, I designed a storyboard, gathered feedback from participants in seven countries, refined the concept, and built my first prototype in Unity. 

It was my first time working with AR and Unity, all within a very limited timeframe, and even setting up the XR simulator proved to be a challenge. There’s still a lot missing, but seeing the companion come to life, turn to face the user, and speak the first line from my storyboard made the process incredibly rewarding.
